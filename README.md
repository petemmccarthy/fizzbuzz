========

Ruby version of fizzbuzz tested with rspec. The exercise was used as part of an introduction to rspec and TDD.

Fizzbuzz is a game whereby the player counts from 1 to 100 but says 'Fizz' instead of any number divisible by 3, 'Buzz' instead of any number divisible by 5 and 'Fizzbuzz' instead of any number divisible by 15.
